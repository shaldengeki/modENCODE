modENCODE
=========

Rails app to track progress towards sequencing modENCODE transcription factor binding sites.

To get started, edit `database.yml.example` to fit your production parameters, rename it to `database.yml`, and run `bundle install` to install dependencies. After that, simply running a `rake db:migrate` should bring you to operational status.
